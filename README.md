# Replication Project of Walker et al. (2019)

**Title:** *Finding meaning in the clouds: Illusory pattern perception predicts receptivity to pseudo-profound bullshit*  
**Original paper:** Walker, A. C., Turpin, M. H., Stolz, J. A., Fugelsang, J. A., & Koehler, D. J. (2019). *Judgment and Decision Making, 14*(2), 109â€“119.

## Overview
This repository contains materials for my PSYCH 251 replication project.  
The goal is to reproduce and extend **Study 3** from Walker et al. (2019), which examined how *illusory pattern perception* - seeing structure or meaning in randomness - relates to receptivity to pseudo-profound statements.

My replication follows the original procedure using a Prolific sample.

I also include a planned extension investigating whether the same cognitive bias predicts belief in misinformation and trust in information sources.

## Repository Structure

This uses the replication project template as well as a file called `anonymize.py` that can remove personally-identifiable information from the data exported by Qualtrics. Just run `python anonymize.py` to anonymize all Qualtrics `csv` files in the `data` directory.
