## Overview
This repository contains materials for my PSYCH 251 replication project.

The goal is to reproduce Study 2 from van Prooijen et al. (2018), which experimentally manipulated intuitive pattern search to test whether heightened pattern perception increases endorsement of irrational beliefs such as conspiracies and supernatural phenomena.

My replication follows the original procedure using a Prolific sample.

## Repository Structure

This uses the replication project template as well as a file called `anonymize.py` that can remove personally-identifiable information from the data exported by Qualtrics. Just run `python anonymize.py` to anonymize all Qualtrics `csv` files in the `data` directory.
